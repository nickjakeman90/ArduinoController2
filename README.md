# ArduinoController2

This program will act as an interface to provide inputs to an Arduino UNO R3.

Currently a .ino file needs to be written and uploaded to the Arduino in order for the Arduino to understand
the commands given by this program.
The goal of this program will be to generate the .ino file for you or atleast in part for basic actions.
